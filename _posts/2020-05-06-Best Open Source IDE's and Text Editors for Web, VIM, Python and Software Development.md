Are you into Software or Web development? Then in one or the other instances you would have come across the Text Editor, be it a code on the Notepad or the latest heavyweight text editors built on the cloud or installed on your computer.
Text Editors have become the part and parcel of every developer. As and when he/she starts venturing into learning new technologies as part of their up-skilling or re-skilling routines, there comes time to know new text editors.
Today we shall list out some of the Open Source Text editors which are sacred applications for developers ☺

**TL;DR**

#### Vscode
Visual Studio Code combines the simplicity of a code editor with what developers need for their core edit-build-debug cycle. It provides comprehensive code editing, navigation and understanding support along with lightweight debugging, a rich extensibility model and lightweight integration with existing tools.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/01texteditor/vscode.jpg)

One of the most happening and developer preferred code editor with the following features which are increasing with every new release:

* IntelliSense: Go beyond syntax highlighting and auto complete with IntelliSense, which provides smart completions based on variable types, function definitions and imported modules.
* Print statement debugging is a thing of the past: Debug code right from the editor. Launch or attach to your running apps and debug with breakpoints, call stacks and an interactive console.
* Git commands built-in: Working with Git and other SCM providers has never been easier. Review differences, stage files and make commits right from the editor. Push and Pull from any hosted SCM service.
* Extensible and Customizable: Want even more features? Install extensions to add new languages, themes, debuggers and to connect to additional services. Extensions run in separate processes ensuring they won’t slow down your editor.
* Deploy with confidence and ease: with Microsoft Azure you can deploy and host your React, Angular, Vue, Node, Python (and more!) sites, store and query relational and document based data and scale with serverless computing, all with ease all from within VS Code.

***

#### Atom
A hackable text editor for the 21st Century. Great things happen when developers work together – from teaching and sharing knowledge to building better software. Teletype for Atom makes collaborating on code just as easy as it is to code alone, right from your editor.
