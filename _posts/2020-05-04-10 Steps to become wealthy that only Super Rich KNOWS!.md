Recently, I was reading an article in Quora about the "_become wealthy in short time_". I was wondering how many quoran's are following this kind of an article? And to my surprise, there were many! When I started digging deeper to find more about this (off course, some googling :)) around 28% of the articles relate to this kind of topic, **MONEY!**.

I am sure the below steps that I shall enumerate, most of the Poor to Middle Class people know about it in one form or the other. But, they lack in is the discipline and "_Priority Hijack_" of mental state. Which on the later stage, they blame on the `Situation`, `Luck` and the _un-seeable_ `God`!

If you are reading this post and are eager to know the steps, here it is:


1. **Ideas don’t matter. Execution does:** Many people get annoyed about a friend implementing `their idea` in business, forgetting that ideas are worthless. Everybody has million dollar ideas
1. **Income matters** - but not as much as spending habits for wealth
1. **Investment returns matter** - but not as much as how long you invest for and how much you contribute
1. **Time in the market** -beats timing the market
1. **Nobody can get 25% consistently** - Many -people get 30% one year, but even Buffett `only` gets 20% a year. So you can’t expect to get 25% a year!
1. **Everybody can get rich investing** - if they are long-term orientated
1. **Beating the market has gotten harder** - even for the pros. You can't `out research` the market
1. **Past success doesn’t always predict the future** - don’t be complacent
1. **Predictions are almost impossible** - there are too may unknown unknowns and known unknowns for the short-term. Longer-term, companies, the cream of the crop, get more profitable over time.
1. **Take the media with a pinch of salt** - they exist to sensationalize. As Peter Lunch says, never get scared;
